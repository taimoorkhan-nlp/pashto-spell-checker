I uses a small digital dictionary of 2000 words as ground truth. 

The corpus is made of randomly sampled 1. research paper abstracts from Pashto journal and 2. BBC Pashto articles. 

Using statistical operations, the model identifies non-word and real word spelling errors, and attempts to correct them. With the help of morphological operations, the model identifies out-of-vocabulary non-word and real word errors and attempts to fix them too.

For more details on the data and model, read the paper in the repo.
